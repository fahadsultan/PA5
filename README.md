<h1><center>Array-based Binary Tree</h1></center>

<br/>

1. In this assignment, you are to implement the `BinaryTreeArray` interface in the `BinaryTreeArray` file provided. The interface defines the methods that you need to implement. 

    Make sure to read the java doc comments in the `BinaryTreeArray` interface to understand the requirements of each method.

    You are to implement the methods in the `BinaryTreeArray` class in the same file. 

    Feel free to define any additional <u>private</u> helper methods or classes as needed. 

2. You are to write JUnit test cases in the `BinaryTreeArrayTest` file to test your implementation.

    Make sure to test all the methods in the `BinaryTreeArray` class, keeping in mind any <u>edge cases</u> that may arise.

## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated based on the correctness **_and completeness_** of your implementation and test cases. If your implementation is correct but your test cases are incomplete, you will lose points. If your implementation is incorrect, you will lose even more points.
